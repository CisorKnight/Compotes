admin.triage.title: 'Triage of potential operations duplicates'
admin.triage.validators.initials_details_must_not_be_lost: |
    When updating an operation for triage, you must keep the original details and only append or prepend a note
    to avoid duplicate operations. If this operation is a true duplicate, you can delete it.
admin.triage.list_help_message: |
    This page lists the different Operations that <em>seem</em> to be duplicates.

    You have two choices here:

    <ul>
        <li>
            If operations are <strong>not</strong> duplicates, you can update the description of one of them <strong>while
            keeping the initial details</strong> (like, appending or prepending a note to distinguish both operations).
            <br>
            The reason you need to keep initial details is to keep the tag rules working for this operation. Else, the
            operation would possibly stop matching some rules and break the synchronization process.
            <br>
            The goal is to make each operation <strong>unique</strong> by having a unique combination of all its fields
            (labels, details, amount, etc.). And to avoid breaking analytics, only details can be updated.
        </li>
        <li>
            If operations <strong>are</strong> duplicates, you can delete the one(s) you don't want.
            <br>
            <strong>Be aware that deleting operations is an irreversible action.</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>

                    Every non-digit character (except <code>&plus;</code> and <code>&minus;</code>) will be removed and all remaining numbers will make the amount <strong>in cents</strong>.
